# jsfc
An online chat application that works without a single bit (pun intended) of JavaScript.   
> [!WARNING]
> JSFC is written as a toy project and _not at all_ with big volumes of messages or high security in mind!

## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> JSFC is written for PHP8 and uses several features that were added in PHP7.x, so it probably breaks if you try to run it with older PHP.

The application itself is a single .php file that you can put anywhere on any server running PHP. 
You should go into the file and scroll past the `license` and `Code formatting notice`, to find the section labelled `config variables`. Look at every variable and value in that section, and with the help of the comments behind each variable decide if and to what you want to change each one.
